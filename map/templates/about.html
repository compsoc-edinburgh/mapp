    <h2>About The Marauder's App</h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    Built at <a href="http://hacknotts.com" target=_blank>HackNotts</a>,
    an MLH student hackathon in 2015, by Angus, Harry and James. We're
    always messaging our coursemates with crap like:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="img-thumbnail center-block img-responsive padder"
         src="{{  url_for('static', filename='img/fbmessage_1.jpg') }}"
         alt="Facebook message: 'Where are people sitting in the labs?'">
  </p>
  <p>
    So we made a webapp to rid ourselves of this annoyance (though James still
    insists on using Messenger...). You can add friends by popping open the
    'Manage Friends' modal, and entering their full names one at a time. The
    format is <code>FirstName SecondName</code>, in fact it is <em>exactly</em>
    the same as what <code>$ finger s13371337</code> returns on DICE, because,
    well, that's where we get people's names from.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you've never heard of <code>finger</code> before then yes, that exists.
    Also it never gets old.
  </p>

    <h2>Help</h2>
  </div>


  <p><i class="fa fa-hand-peace-o text-info"></i><span class="spacer"></span>
    someone in your friends list is on this computer.
  </p>
  <p><i class="fa fa-television text-success"></i><span class="spacer"></span>
    means this machine is free to use.
  </p>
  <p><i class="fa fa-television text-danger"></i><span class="spacer"></span>
    these ones are offline, and are probably available.
  </p>
  <p><i class="fa fa-television muted"></i><span class="spacer"></span>
    and these have someone using them, though <em>sometimes</em> people forget to log out.
  </p>
  
  <div class="text-center padder">
    <h2>Privacy</h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    Obviously we take people's privacy pretty seriously, which is why the app
    only works over a secured connection, using HTTPS.
  </p>

  <p>
    We scan DICE machines over SSH, running <code>finger</code> on each one
    to see who's on it. The username of the person on the machine then gets
    hashed using sha-512 and a salt. The hash and machine details are then
    pushed back here and stored in <a href="http://redis.io">Redis</a> before
    being rendered as a map for you, dear user.
  </p>

  <p>
    This means a couple of important things - We don't know who is where, as all we see
    is a big nasty hash like <code>5d96a594f5 485a89fa0f ac073f1b6b d5b2e5cf81
      c193495e93 4c2a6ece4b 007709a4c1 db1070a7b5 9f571f269b 7ef69bfb5b
      ab3e8a2e04 835e6635ec 7271a03a</code> which is what we store. There's no software
    running persistently on DICE machines, no way to execute arbitrary code on the DICE
    boxes and communication between the bot and this server is one-way. Also everything
    we knew about the lab last time we checked it out is overwritten, as we don't log
    nor do we have persistent storage. Redis is great like that.
  </p>

  <p>
    None of the collected data ever leaves .ed.ac.uk or the Informatics firewall,
    and all update information is sent between servers securely. API keys and
    hashing salts are easily changed and all our data is meaningless with incorrect
    copies of these.
  </p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
  </div>

  <blockquote>
    Doesn't something like this already exist?
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Apparently it does, <a href="http://www.linuxcommand.org/man_pages/rwho1.html">rwho</a>
    is a thing. Apparently it also used to be on DICE, but no more. So now you have
    this snazzy thing instead.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Plans for the future?
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Biggest planned improvements are expansion out of the Drill Hall into other labs
    and rooms in Forrest Hill; Adding some additional privacy wherein people have to
    'accept' a friendship to show up on another person's map; And finally handy things
    like notifying users of where friends are, where there are free computers and
    where empty rooms (if any) are.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Is this legal?
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Yes, all DICE users have access to the same information that we do, and we're
    within the bounds of the DPA and CMA.
